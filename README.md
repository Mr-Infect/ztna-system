# Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) Implementation in Python

A comprehensive Zero Trust Network Access solution that implements core ZTNA principles including multi-factor authentication, device health monitoring, and continuous access verification.

## Features

**Core Components:**
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) System
- Device Health Checker
- Core Policy Engine
- Login Activity Monitor
- User Activity Tracker
- Report Generator

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture implementing the "trust no one, verify everything" principle. Each component works together to provide:

- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Real-time device security posture assessment
- Granular access control policies
- Activity monitoring and threat detection
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

## Installation

```bash
https://github.com/Mr-Infect/ztna-system
cd ztna-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from ztna import ZTNAController

# Initialize the ZTNA controller
ztna = ZTNAController()

# Start the service
ztna.start()
```

## Component Details

**Multi-Factor Authentication**
- Supports multiple authentication factors
- Implements secure token management
- Prevents MFA bombing through rate limiting

**Device Health Checker**
- Validates device security status
- Performs continuous compliance checks
- Monitors security patch status.

**Core Policy Engine**
- Enforces least-privilege access
- Implements granular access controls
- Provides dynamic policy updates.
